        <div class="inContent"> Female medical professionals who worked at the front line of pandemic
        control were suffering from the negligence of government officials
        who excluded sanitary pads (or hygiene products like overnight
        underwear-like sanitary pads) from the list of medical necessities.
        Having long working hours in PPEs, female medical professionals were
        unable to go to the bathroom for a entire day, for once they leave the
        contaminated area, they will need a new set of PPE to reenter.
        Without sanitary pads orabsorbent sanitary pants when confined in hospitals,
        they used plastic wraps, adult diapers as substitutes, or they often
        stayed in their PPE for hours without eating, drinking, or going to the bathroom, or they
         would run out of underwear and would wear PPE directly, sometimes covered in blood.
         These problems were directly caused by sexist policies which didn’t consider
         feminine hygiene products as official “emergency relief supplies.”

          To deal with the logistic challenges caused by this sexist policy,
          Liang and her team worked tirelessly to coordinate their work.
          Using Weibo, she called for both manufacturers who agreed to donate
          and hospitals who agreed to accept donations to report on how supplies
          were transported and distributed to people in need. While such public
          attention could hold them accountable, it was more important that the
          policy change so that these products could be labeled as “emergency
          relief supplies” and enjoy the benefits of “green channels” or officially
          sanctioned logistic networks by the National Health Commission and
          the State Post Bureau. She also shared ways for the
          public to use Weibo to amplify this cause and to write directly to
          government institutions in charge of epidemic relief to call for this
          policy change. <br><br>
