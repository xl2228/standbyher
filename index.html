            <br>As a response to the fast spread of the novel coronavirus in China,
             the lockdown quickly implemented in Wuhan on Jan 23 had many ripple effects.
              Women medical professionals and their needs were especially not
              heeded even when various medical relief efforts coming from all
              over China rushed to the epicenter.<br><br><br>
            “Stand By Her” exemplified a feminist activism grounded in lived
            experiences of Chinese women, pushing through a sociopolitical context
            often quite hostile to women and to grassroots organizing. From Liang’s
            Weibo posts, we learned a lot about the challenges women medical professionals
            faced since the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.

      <p>
        Female medical professionals who worked at the front line of pandemic
        control were suffering from the negligence of government officials
        who excluded sanitary pads (or hygiene products like overnight
        underwear-like sanitary pads) from the list of medical necessities.
        Having long working hours in PPEs, female medical professionals were
        unable to go to the bathroom for a entire day, for once they leave the
        contaminated area, they will need a new set of PPE to reenter...

                Inspired by the campaign of raising awareness regarding menstrual
                 health and period poverty, Chinese students have launched a
                 program setting up free sanitary pad dispensers in toilets at
                 universities across the country in a bid to end period shaming
                 of young women. “Sanitary pad support boxes” have been set up in
                 almost 500 campuses, all by female student volunteers who volunteered
                 to help those in need and end the shame when talking about menstruation,
